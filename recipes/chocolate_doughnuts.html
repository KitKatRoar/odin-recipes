        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Dough</h3>
            <ul>3/4 cup whole milk</ul>
            <ul></ul>2 large eggs</ul>
            <ul></ul>2 egg yolks</ul>
            <ul></ul>3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more as needed</ul>
            <ul></ul>1/4 cup granulated sugar</ul>
            <ul></ul>1 tablespoon active dry yeast</ul>
            <ul></ul>1 teaspoon kosher salt</ul>
            <ul></ul>6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature, cut into pieces,
            plus more for greasing</ul>
            <ul></ul>Canola oil, for frying</ul>
        <h3>Glaze</h3>
            <ul>1 1/2 cup powdered sugar, sifted</ul>
            <ul>1/4 cup cocoa powder, preferably Dutch process</ul>
            <ul>Pinch of kosher salt</ul>
            <ul>3 to 4 tablespoons whole milk</ul>
            <ul>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</ul>
            <ul>Sprinkles</ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    For the dough, bring the milk just to a boil over medium heat in a small pot. Watch closely to ensure that the milk doesn’t boil over. Transfer the milk mixture to a measuring cup and top it off with enough water to bring the level back to 3/4 cup. Let it cool to around 115° F, about 15 minutes (It will be warm to the touch but not too hot.) Add the eggs and egg yolks to the warm milk mixture and whisk to combine.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or in a large bowl with a wooden spoon, combine the flour, granulated sugar, yeast, and salt. Add the milk mixture and mix until just combined. Switch to the dough hook and knead the dough on low speed, about 3 minutes. Alternatively, knead the dough by hand in the bowl for about 6 minutes. The dough should be smooth and workable, but still somewhat sticky. If the dough appears too sticky, add up to 3 tablespoons more of flour, but resist the urge to add too much.
Add the butter, one or two pieces at a time. It may look like it’s not getting in there, but don’t worry, it will; just keep adding and kneading. If necessary, stop the mixer and knead by hand to incorporate the first couple of pieces. Once the butter is incorporated, increase the speed to medium and knead the dough for another few minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. Or, tip the dough onto a very lightly floured work surface and knead by hand until smooth. Transfer the dough to a buttered bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise until doubled in size, 1 to 3 hours. It’s best to watch the dough rather than the clock.
Tip the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead it a couple times to push out the air. Roll the dough into a 9 1/2 by 12 1/2-inch rectangle, about 1/2-inch thick. Line a baking sheet with a dish towel and dust well with flour. Using a 4-inch round cutter, cut the dough into 6 circles. Using a 1-inch round cutter (or another shape of your choice), cut a 1-inch circle cut out of the center of each dough round. Lightly cover with plastic wrap, set in a warm place, and allow to double in size, 30 minutes to 2 hours.
In a heavy-bottomed pot fitted with a deep-fry thermometer, heat 2 inches of the canola oil to 350° F, and set a rack inside a baking sheet or line with paper towels. If you don’t have a thermometer, throw a few pinches of flour in the oil. If it sizzles, it’s ready. Using a flat slotted spoon, gently lower the dough circles into the hot oil, working a few at a time. Fry until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Let cool slightly until they are cool enough to handle, about 10 minutes.
For the glaze, combine the powdered sugar, cocoa powder, and salt in a shallow bowl. Add the milk and vanilla and whisk until smooth.
Dip the doughnuts in the glaze and let the excess drip back into the bowl. Transfer to the same baking sheet and top with plenty of sprinkles.
The doughnuts are best served the same day as frying.
